Athena is a modern blockchain operating system being developed by [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) for running programs (a.k.a. smart contracts) in a manner that's performant, deterministic, and efficiently provable. For more information see [the Athena repository](https://github.com/athenavm/athena), [Introducing Athena](https://spacemesh.io/blog/introducing-athena/) and the [athenavm organization](https://github.com/athenavm) on Github.
